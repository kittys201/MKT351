        <div class="profile-section">
            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jennifer González</strong>. I am originally from Venezuela, but for several years now I have been living in São Paulo, Brazil, where I have built a new stage of my life. I have been married for more than 15 years, and I believe this experience has taught me a lot about commitment, patience, and teamwork within marriage and family life.</p>
            
            <p>Regarding my studies, I like to describe myself as an <span class="highlight">"invading student,"</span> since my main career is in software development. However, I decided to expand my knowledge in other areas that I consider valuable for my professional and personal growth, especially as I plan to become an entrepreneur in the technology sector. It has been very interesting to discover that the vision and paradigm of business are quite different from those of software development, and this has opened new perspectives and opportunities for me.</p>
            
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy different activities. One of them is knitting, which I find both relaxing and creative. I also love singing at church, where I am a member of the choir, an experience that strengthens my faith and connects me with my community. Additionally, I am a big fan of Asian dramas, and this has inspired me to learn an Asian language someday—Chinese, Korean, or Japanese—because I believe it would open the door to new cultures and learning experiences.</p>

                <h4>Campaign/Publication:</h4>
                <p>Massive advertising campaigns, often on television, YouTube, and social media, featuring public figures like Alok or celebrities like Olivia Rodrigo. These campaigns focus on aspirational or social themes, such as human connection, commitment to sustainability, or reflection on technology use.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h4>Content:</h4>
                <p>The objective of these campaigns is not to sell directly, but to generate an emotional connection with the brand and increase its visibility. The content is evocative, aspirational, and seeks to resonate with a broad audience that may or may not be Vivo customers. Instead of detailing product features, these campaigns establish the brand's values and positioning. For example, the campaign with Olivia Rodrigo focuses on mental health and conscious phone use, positioning Vivo as a brand that cares about user well-being.</p>

                <h4>Campaign/Publication:</h4>
                <p>Product pages on Vivo's website, such as the "Para Você" section, which detail plans and services (e.g., Vivo Pós, Vivo Fibra, Vivo Easy). Another example would be the use of the "Live Commerce" function mentioned in their marketing strategy, where product demonstrations are shown and questions are answered in real-time.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h4>Content:</h4>
                <p>Content at this stage is highly informative and educational. It provides specific details about the benefits of each plan, such as the amount of gigabytes, included applications (e.g., Amazon Prime, Vivo Travel Americas), and other extras (e.g., Cinemark discounts). At this point, the potential customer already knows the brand and is evaluating whether their offers meet their needs. Live demonstrations and detailed product descriptions help build trust and allow the customer to compare options before making a decision.</p>

                <h4>Campaign/Publication:</h4>
                <p>Specific offer advertisements with a clear call to action, such as "Assinar plano" (Subscribe to plan) or "Contratar" (Hire). Examples include the Vivo Pós plan of 66 GB with a portability bonus, the Vivo Controle plan with an extra bonus for social networks, or the promotion for a new chip with the "PRETHETOWN" coupon. These ads are found in website banners, retargeting campaigns, and email marketing.</p>

                <h4>Content:</h4>

Calls to action are clear and direct, guiding the user toward the final purchase step.</p>

                </div>
                
                <div class="flow-step">
                    <h4>Builds interest</h4>
                    <p>Interested, the person might search "Vivo plans" on Google and land on a Consideration page of the website, where they compare different plans and services that fit their needs.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="flow-step">
                    <h4>Drives action</h4>
                    <p>Finally, a Conversion ad or offer (like a portability bonus or discount) appears in a banner while browsing, providing the final push needed to make the decision and "Assinar" (subscribe) to the plan they've been considering.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>This way, Vivo uses different types of content for each stage of the funnel, ensuring that communication is relevant and effective for each customer, regardless of where they are in the purchasing process.</p>
